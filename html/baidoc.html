      Education helps people learn and grow. When we learn, we understand the
      world better. Children go to school to learn new things like reading,
      writing, and counting.

      Teachers help students step by step, and students learn by listening,
      asking questions, and practicing every day. Education is not only in the
      classroom. People can learn at home from books, audio lessons, and videos. Education
      gives people more chances in life and helps everyone feel confident.
